## 📌 What is a Derivative?

A **derivative** represents the **instantaneous rate of change** of a function at a specific point. It provides the slope of the tangent line to the function's graph at that point.

**Mathematical Definition:**

$$
f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}
$$

This is known as the **difference quotient**.

## 🔍 Average vs. Instantaneous Rate of Change

* **Average Rate of Change**: Measures the change in the function's value over an interval $[a, b]$:

$$
\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
$$

* **Instantaneous Rate of Change**: Represents the rate at which the function's value changes at a specific point, equivalent to the slope of the tangent line at that point.

## 📏 Secant Line and Slope

* **Secant Line**: A line that intersects a curve at two points. Its slope represents the average rate of change between those two points.

* **Tangent Line**: A line that touches the curve at exactly one point. Its slope represents the instantaneous rate of change at that point.

## 🧮 Derivative Notations

Different notations are used to represent derivatives:

* **Lagrange Notation:** $f'(x)$  
* **Leibniz Notation:** $\frac{dy}{dx}$  
* **Newton Notation:** $\dot{y}$

## 📐 Tangent Line Equation

The equation of a tangent line at a point $(a, f(a))$ is given by:

$$
y - f(a) = f'(a) \cdot (x - a)
$$

This is the **point-slope form** of the line.

## 📈 Derivative as Slope of Curve

The derivative at a point gives the slope of the tangent line to the curve at that point, indicating how steep the curve is at that specific location.

---

## 🔄 Average Rate of Change Formula

The average rate of change of a function $f(x)$ over the interval $[a, b]$ is:

$$
\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
$$

## 📘 Power Rule and Basic Derivative Rules

* **Power Rule**: For $f(x) = x^n$, the derivative is:

$$
f'(x) = n \cdot x^{n-1}
$$

* **Constant Rule**: The derivative of a constant is $0$  
* **Constant Multiple Rule**: The derivative of $c \cdot f(x)$ is $c \cdot f'(x)$  
* **Sum/Difference Rule**: The derivative of $f(x) + g(x)$ is $f'(x) + g'(x)$, and similarly for subtraction

---

## 📊 Differentiating Polynomials

To differentiate a polynomial:

1. Apply the power rule to each term  
2. Combine the results

**Example:**

For $f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2 - x + 5$,

$$
f'(x) = 9x^2 + 4x - 1
$$

Slope of tangent line at any $x$-value is $f'(x)$.

## 🔢 Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions

* $\frac{d}{dx}(\sin x) = \cos x$  
* $\frac{d}{dx}(\cos x) = -\sin x$  
* $\frac{d}{dx}(\tan x) = \sec^2 x$  
* $\frac{d}{dx}(\cot x) = -\csc^2 x$  
* $\frac{d}{dx}(\sec x) = \sec x \cdot \tan x$  
* $\frac{d}{dx}(\csc x) = -\csc x \cdot \cot x$

---

## 🔢 Derivatives of Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

* $\frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = e^x$  
* $\frac{d}{dx}(a^x) = a^x \cdot \ln(a)$, $a > 0$  
* $\frac{d}{dx}(\ln x) = \frac{1}{x}$, $x > 0$

---

## 📈 Product and Quotient Rules

* **Product Rule**: For $f(x) = u(x) \cdot v(x)$,

$$
f'(x) = u'(x) \cdot v(x) + u(x) \cdot v'(x)
$$

* **Quotient Rule**: For $f(x) = \frac{u(x)}{v(x)}$,

$$
f'(x) = \frac{v(x) \cdot u'(x) - u(x) \cdot v'(x)}{(v(x))^2}
$$

---

## 📐 Slope of Normal Line

The slope of the **normal line** to a curve at a point is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the tangent line at that point:

$$
m_\text{normal} = -\frac{1}{m_\text{tangent}}
$$
