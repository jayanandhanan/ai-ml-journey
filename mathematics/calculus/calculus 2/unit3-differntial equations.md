## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This unit introduces **differential equations** and their applications. It revisits many concepts from **Calculus 1 â€“ Unit 7: Differential Equations**, including slope fields, separation of variables, and particular solutions, and adds new topics like **logistic models** and **Eulerâ€™s method** for numerical approximations.

## ðŸ“Œ Differential Equations â€” Key Concepts

A **differential equation** relates a function $y(x)$ to its derivative $y'(x)$:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y)
$$

**Solution:** A function $y(x)$ satisfying the equation.

**Verifying a solution:** Substitute $y(x)$ and its derivative into the differential equation and check equality.

## ðŸ“Œ Logistic Models

Accounts for **limited resources**. Differential equation:

$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = rP\left(1-\frac{P}{K}\right)
$$

- $P(t)$: population at time $t$  
- $r$: growth rate  
- $K$: carrying capacity  

**Solution:**

$$
P(t) = \frac{K}{1 + \left(\frac{K-P_0}{P_0}\right)e^{-rt}}
$$

**Example:**

Initial population $P_0 = 100$, $K = 500$, $r = 0.1$:

$$
P(t) = \frac{500}{1 + 4 e^{-0.1 t}}
$$

## ðŸ“Œ Eulerâ€™s Method

Numerical approximation of solutions:

- Step size $h$  
- Recurrence:

$$
y_{n+1} = y_n + h f(x_n, y_n)
$$

**Example:**

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = y, \quad y(0)=1 \, h=0.1
$$

- $y_1 = y_0 + 0.1 y_0 = 1 + 0.1 = 1.1$  
- $y_2 = 1.1 + 0.1(1.1) = 1.21$  
- Continue iteratively
