## ðŸ“Œ Differential Equations â€” Key Concepts

A **differential equation** relates a function $y(x)$ to its derivative $y'(x)$:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y)
$$

**Solution:** A function $y(x)$ satisfying the equation.

**Verifying a solution:** Substitute $y(x)$ and its derivative into the differential equation and check equality.

## ðŸ“Œ Slope Fields

- Visual representation of the slope $\frac{dy}{dx}$ at given $(x,y)$ points.
- Helps **reason about the behavior** of solutions without solving analytically.

**Example:**  

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = y \implies \text{slopes increase as } y \text{ increases.}
$$

## ðŸ“Œ Separation of Variables

For equations of the form:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = g(x)h(y)
$$

Separate:

$$
\frac{1}{h(y)} dy = g(x) dx
$$

Integrate both sides:

$$
\int \frac{1}{h(y)} dy = \int g(x) dx + C
$$

**Example:**  

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = y \implies \frac{dy}{y} = dx \implies \ln|y| = x + C \implies y = Ce^x
$$

---

## ðŸ“Œ Particular Solutions

Use **initial conditions** $y(x_0) = y_0$ to find $C$:

$$
y(x) = Ce^x, \quad y(0)=2 \implies 2 = C e^0 \implies C=2
$$

---

## ðŸ“Œ Exponential Growth and Decay

Differential equation:

$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = ky
$$

Solution:

$$
y(t) = y_0 e^{kt}
$$

- $k>0$: growth  
- $k<0$: decay

## ðŸ“Œ Logistic Models

Accounts for **limited resources**. Differential equation:

$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = rP\left(1-\frac{P}{K}\right)
$$

- $P(t)$: population at time $t$  
- $r$: growth rate  
- $K$: carrying capacity  

**Solution:**

$$
P(t) = \frac{K}{1 + \left(\frac{K-P_0}{P_0}\right)e^{-rt}}
$$

**Example:**

Initial population $P_0 = 100$, $K = 500$, $r = 0.1$:

$$
P(t) = \frac{500}{1 + 4 e^{-0.1 t}}
$$

## ðŸ“Œ Eulerâ€™s Method

Numerical approximation of solutions:

- Step size $h$  
- Recurrence:

$$
y_{n+1} = y_n + h f(x_n, y_n)
$$

**Example:**

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = y, \quad y(0)=1, \, h=0.1
$$

- $y_1 = y_0 + 0.1 y_0 = 1 + 0.1 = 1.1$  
- $y_2 = 1.1 + 0.1(1.1) = 1.21$  
- Continue iteratively
