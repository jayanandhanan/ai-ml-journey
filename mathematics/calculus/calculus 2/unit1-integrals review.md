## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This unit revisits the **fundamental ideas of integration** from Calculus 1, including the definition of integrals, Riemann sums, accumulation functions, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

All these concepts were previously covered in **Calculus 1 â€“ Unit 6: Integrals**, which explains them in full detail.
