## 🎯 Overview

This unit revisits core concepts of **integration** from *Calculus 1*, providing a foundation for the new techniques introduced later in *Calculus 2*.

All main topics in this unit were already covered in **Calculus 1 – Unit 6: Integrals**, including:

- Accumulations of change and the meaning of integrals  
- Approximation with Riemann sums  
- Summation notation and sigma form  
- Defining integrals using Riemann sums  
- Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Parts 1 & 2)  
- Interpreting accumulation functions  
- Properties of definite integrals  
- Reverse power rule  
- Common indefinite and definite integrals  

🔁 *New in this unit:*  
- Proof-oriented videos emphasizing theoretical understanding of integral properties.

## 🧩 Key Takeaway

This unit serves as a **conceptual bridge** between *Calculus 1* and the advanced **Integration Techniques** that begin in *Calculus 2 Unit 2* (e.g., *u-substitution*, *integration by parts*, *partial fractions*).
